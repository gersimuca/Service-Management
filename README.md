# Service Management API

The Service Management API is a Java-based RESTful web service developed using the Spring framework. It provides endpoints to display website descriptions, services, and products, and also manages authentication for secure access to the API.

## Features

- Display website description: The API provides an endpoint to retrieve the description of the website.
- Manage services: Endpoints are available to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on services. Services represent the various offerings provided by the website.
- Manage products: Endpoints are available to perform CRUD operations on products. Products represent the individual items or offerings available within the services.
- Authentication: The API implements authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to the endpoints. Users are required to authenticate before accessing protected resources.

## Technologies Used

The Service Management API is built using the following technologies:

- Java: The API is developed using Java programming language.
- Spring Framework: The Spring framework is used to provide a robust and scalable foundation for building the API.
- Spring Boot: Spring Boot is utilized to simplify the setup and configuration of the API.
- RESTful Architecture: The API follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) for designing the endpoints.
- Spring Security: Spring Security is employed to handle authentication and authorization requirements.
- Database: A database system such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB is used to store the website's information, services, and products.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Service Management API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone # Service Management

## Getting Started

To get started with the Service Management API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/gersimuca/Service-Management.git`
2. Install Java: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
3. Set up the database: Configure your database system and update the necessary credentials in the application configuration.
4. Build the project: Navigate to the project directory and build the project using your preferred build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle).
5. Run the API: Start the API using the provided command or script.
6. Test the API: Access the API endpoints using a tool like cURL or Postman to perform operations on website descriptions, services, and products.
7. Implement authentication: Customize the authentication mechanism based on your requirements, such as integrating with an identity provider or implementing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
